        info: 'A one-of-a-kind home of your dreams. Meticulously designed by award-winning architect Mark English, this 2017 modern new-build is an engineering masterpiece. From the floating bridge connecting the upper levels, to the quiet from having radiant floor heating and cooling, you will feel as if youâ€™ve entered a private another world when you walk through the dramatic front entrance. Spacious and open, indoor and outdoor become one with retracting glass walls throughout the main level. This allows for natural light to flow throughout the home, perpetuating the sense of serenity, and striking a fascinating contrast with its modern, contemporary details.'
